# Spell_Checker
Reads an input file containing words that make up the dictionary for the spell-checker, then reads an input file to be checked against the dictionary. Outputs misspelled words, the line they appear on in the input file, and spelling suggestions (if any) based on multiple spelling errors: insertion, deletion, adjacent transposition, and replacement. The dictionary is stored in a hash table that utilizes quadratic probing. The output file also includes hash table statistics such as number of words, size of table, load factor, number of collisions. Also included are the average chain length and longest chain length for the spelling suggestions.
